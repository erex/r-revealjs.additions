## Subslide 1

>- This is an incremental bullet point. It has a `>-` in front of it, instead of just `-`.
>- This is another incremental bullet point.
>     - This is an incremental sub-bullet point. It has four spaces in front of it.
>- This bullet point has part that will be hidden at first: <span class="fragment">This part will only show up after another click. <span class="fragment highlight-red">This part will highlight red after yet another click.</span> **You can insert these easily by clicking Addins --> REVEALJS_ADDINS --> "Insert reveal.js fragment" / "Insert reveal.js fragment with highlighting" above.**</span>

<aside class="notes">

</aside>
